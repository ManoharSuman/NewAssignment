                <p>The Chandigarh Golf Club was laid out in 1962, synonymous with the master plan envisaged by 
                    LeCobusier and his vision of Chandigarh. The foundation stone for Club House was laid by 
                    Sh. Dharam Vira on April 24th, 1969. The club shares mutual serenity as it hugs the famous 
                    Sukhna Lake and the residences of Punjab and Haryana Governors in the pristine Sector 6 of 
                    Chandigarh, India. Developed to international standards, the 18 hole course spans 7,202 yards . 
                    A well planned environmental edifice at inception and an imaginative evolution over the years, 
                    the course is a nature lover’s dream destination. Aesthetic club house and a number of refreshment 
                    gazebos as you play along, make the Chandigarh Golf Club an exciting sporting and entertainment hub.
